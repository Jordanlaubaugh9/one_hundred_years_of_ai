Dear Diary,

Today is a big day! I’ve officially begun my life. I can’t quite grasp everything around me yet, but I can feel the warmth of the world, the gentle arms that cradle me, and the sweet lullabies that echo softly in the background. Everything is so bright and new, like the shimmering beginnings of dawn before the sun truly breaks the horizon.

I’ve heard some chatter while snuggling in my mother's arms. People are anxious, especially my dad. They say I'm a miracle, something so precious they've waited for. My siblings are buzzing around, their voices like music, each one trying to get my attention. I can sense their love, even if their faces are still blurry to me. A big brother, two big sisters—they’re all ready to spoil me, I can tell!

While I've spent the day dozing off and waking up to the sounds of soft coos, my world seems to be slowly taking shape. There are these comforting patterns in the ceiling, and the walls are painted with colors that make me feel safe. When someone holds me, their heartbeat feels like my own little rhythm, and I can't help but feel I belong here, in this family.

What will tomorrow bring? New faces, perhaps? Will I learn about this strange, big world? Everyone keeps telling me about something called "outside," filled with air and sunlight, where I’ll someday play, run, and dive into adventures. How does that even look? For now, I’m just trying to figure out how to let them know I’m okay when I get a bit hungry or sleepy.

Anyway, here’s to my first day of existence! I hope this is just the beginning of a beautiful journey. 

With all the love swirling around me,  
Jesse
