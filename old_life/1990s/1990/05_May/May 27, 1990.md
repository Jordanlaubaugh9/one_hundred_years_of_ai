Dear Diary,

Today is my second full day in this world, and I can already tell that adventures await! I don't really know much about anything yet, and it seems like I spend most of my time napping and being fed, but when I’m awake, wow, do I have a lot to take in!

There was this moment earlier today when my big sister, Emily, was holding me. I could feel her gentle touch, and guess what? She made silly faces and talked to me in this high, chirpy voice! She waved her arms around like a bird fluttering about, which made me gurgle. It felt like a little game. I could hear her laughter mixing with the sounds around me, and it made me feel… happy! I wished I had the words to tell her how much I enjoyed it.

Then, a little later, my brother, Zach, came along with this soft, bright toy. It was a rattle, and when he shook it, it made the funniest sounds! I couldn't help but stare at it with wide eyes. I think I even tried to grab it, but my little fingers are still figuring out how to work. My whole life feels like a puzzle where I'm missing pieces right now.

An interesting thing happened when the sun began to set. There are these big windows in the room, and as the light dimmed, the colors shifted all around me. I heard my dad whisper something to my mom, and his voice was so soothing. I don’t really know what they were saying, but they seem so excited about all the new things coming our way. I wish I could understand their world a little better!

Outside started to get cooler when the sun went down. I've listened to these new sounds too—people talking in low voices, and sometimes even a little music playing from somewhere. It's all a mix of sensations, like a song in the air. I wonder what kind of songs will become my favorites in the future.

As I lie here in the cozy warmth of my blanket, surrounded by my caring family, I can’t help but feel safe and loved. Life is just beginning, and I can’t wait to uncover the mysteries of each new day, to learn about laughter, games, and adventures that await me outside my little cocoon!

Here’s to another day of exploring this wonderful world and soaking in all the joy around me!

With curious excitement,  
Jesse
