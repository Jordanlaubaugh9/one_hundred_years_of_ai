Dear Journal,

Today is Thursday. It’s funny how the days of the week have such a rhythm to them, like a heartbeat. I woke up this morning in my crib, kicking my legs and cooing. The sunlight peeked through the curtains, and I felt the warmth on my little face. I wonder if that's what the sun does in the sky, playing peek-a-boo with everyone down here!

Today was full of new adventures! Mom took me to the park for the first time. I was snug in my stroller, gazing wide-eyed at all the big trees and bright flowers. I could hear kids laughing and playing on the swings, and I wanted to know what all the fun was about! Seriously, there’s just something about the sound of their giggles that makes my tiny heart race. 

While I was there, a woman walked by with a fluffy puppy, and oh boy, it was the most beautiful creature I ever saw! I couldn't stop reaching my chubby little hands toward it, wondering if it would come to say hello. Mom laughed and said I would have to wait a bit longer before I could have a dog of my own. I can hardly wait! I hope it’s as fluffy and wild as the one I saw today!

Later in the afternoon, I got to spend some time with my siblings. My oldest sister sat next to me and made silly faces, which made me giggle. My brother pretended to be a superhero, swooping around the living room just out of reach of my tiny fingers. It’s like they’re from a different world, those big kids. I want to grow up fast so I can play like that too!

Oh, and did you know that today in the world, NASA announced the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope? How cool is that? I can't even comprehend space yet, but if I could, I think I'd want to reach out and grab some stars! It’s funny to think about the world beyond my little room.

As night fell and the moon light shone softly, I felt sleepy. Dad read me a bedtime story — it was about wizards and fantastical creatures, which made me think about all the magic in this world and beyond. 

I may be just a baby, but I can dream big, can't I? 

Signing off for tonight,  
Jesse
