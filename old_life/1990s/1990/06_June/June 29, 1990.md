Dear Journal,

Today is Friday, June 29, 1990, and wow, what a day it has been! First, I learned that it’s the day the world celebrated the 20th anniversary of the popular video game 'Pong'—how cool is that? Not that I totally understand what a video game is yet, but it sounds exciting! I can't wait to be big enough to play games that make those funny beeping sounds!

This morning, I woke up bright and early, my little hands stretching above my head as I yawned loudly, which probably startled my puppy—oh, wait! I don’t have one yet. But like I said before, I am ready to meet a fluffy friend soon! 

After breakfast, something new happened! Mom laid a blanket down on the soft grass in the backyard, and I had a mini picnic! I don’t think I’ve ever been on grass! It felt so cool and ticklish beneath me. I wiggled around and tried to grab at the blades, and I think a few grasshoppers jumped away from me. It was a silly game—catch the grasshopper! I imagine one day I'll be running around after them!

Sitting outside, I watched the clouds float by, and I tried to grab them too! I couldn't help but giggle at how they were all different shapes and colors—it's like nature’s own artwork up there in the blue sky. I’ve heard adults talk about how clouds can make rain; I wonder if they ever feel sad when they rain down. 

In the afternoon, my sister came to play with me. She sat next to me and told me stories—some about adventures in far-off lands with knights and dragons, and others about traveling in spaceships! She has such a wild imagination, which made me imagine what it would be like to be on a grand adventure myself. If only I could walk already!

Later, mom took me to the grocery store. While she picked out fruits and veggies, I stared wide-eyed at everything around me. There were so many colors—just like the clouds! I heard a baby somewhere giggling and suddenly, it felt like a little party of laughter surrounded by veggies. I can’t wait to discover the world more. Every day is a new adventure!

As the sun set, I felt tired but happy. Dad gave me a bubbly bath, which was splish-splashy fun! He made silly faces at me while I splashed the water everywhere! I could sink deeper into the bubbles and feel like I was in a magical castle with enchanted waters. 

This world is filled with wonder, laughter, and love, and I can’t wait for more days like today! Here's to baby steps towards big adventures!

Goodnight for now,  
Jesse
