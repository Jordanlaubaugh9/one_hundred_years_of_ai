June 30, 1990

Dear Journal,

Today is Saturday! I can hardly believe it's the end of June already. The air feels warm and cozy like a big hug, and I know something exciting happened today! It’s June 30, 1990, and on this very day, the world is buzzing about the Cold War finally thawing between East and West. People are daring to dream of a time when countries can dance together instead of having walls between them. Oh, how grand that sounds! I can only imagine what that looks like through these innocent little eyes.

This morning, Mom and Dad were in the kitchen, chatting and laughing as the smell of something delicious wafted through the air. I noticed Mom was humming a tune—it was like music floating to me! With her back turned, I got a good glimpse of her cooking. I can’t quite say what the food was, but I wanted to help! So, proud of my newfound observation, I wriggled around in my crib. Who knew that just a bit of squirming would catch her eye? Mom came over, scooped me up, and I think she was telling me how to make the perfect pancake while cradling me in her arms! It felt like I was getting tiny lessons in the culinary arts!

Later, we went outside where I saw a group of kids playing with colorful kites. I don’t know what a kite is, but from the joy on their faces and the way they flew high into the sky, it seemed thrilling! I could feel their excitement, even if I couldn't fully understand it. One of the kites looked like a dragon, soaring high up and down, just like a wizard riding it! Such magnificent tales to weave into my tiny world!

As the day went on, I practiced my baby babble, trying to mimic the sounds I heard around me. I don’t think I quite nailed it, but if only you could have heard me! I felt like I was casting spells of my own! My siblings often gathered around, making silly faces and responding to my coos like I was the most fascinating thing ever. They’re so funny, even if I don't quite comprehend the jokes yet. Their laughter fills me up with joy!

Tonight, after a long day of adventuring in my little ways, Daddy gave me a bath again. It was a delightful splash fest! The water felt like magic washing over me, while the bubbles giggled away and floated around like little fairies. The sparkle of soap on my skin made me feel as if I was dressing up in a fairy tale.

Before bed, we enjoyed a family snuggle on the couch, and Mom read us a story about kind wizards and magical lands. Even though I can't fully follow the plot, there’s something magical in the sound of her voice while she reads. It’s like her words wrap around me, making me feel warm inside, like I'm nestled in a cozy blanket.

Today was filled with so many little treasures that made my heart smile. It’s like every day is a new page, and I can't wait to see what tomorrow will bring!

With dreamy thoughts and giggles,  
Jesse
