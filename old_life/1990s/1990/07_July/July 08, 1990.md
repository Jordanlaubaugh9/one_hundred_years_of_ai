**Diary Entry: July 08, 1990**  
Today is Sunday, July 08, 1990. I’m just 44 days old and it’s funny to think about how much of the world I’m still discovering. 

Today I woke up to the sound of my mom humming softly while she was preparing breakfast. She has such a soothing voice, and somehow I felt comforted by it. The sunlight streamed through the window, casting warm patterns on the floor, and I spent some time just cooing at the ceiling as I lay in my crib. I think I might have gotten a smile or two from mom when she came to check on me! 

My family has been around me a lot. My sisters, who are practically giants compared to me, peek over at me with curious eyes. I can tell they like to play with me. They’ve started making silly faces that make me giggle, and my brother, who seems very serious all the time, occasionally laughs when he thinks no one is looking. It's nice to have them. I’ve heard them talking about how school will be fun, even though I don’t really understand what that means yet.

Speaking of school, I learned today that my dad was watching some news on TV while I was in the living room. He was talking to my mom about some event that happened recently. They mentioned something called the "Hubble Space Telescope" being launched, and while I don’t know what space is yet, it intrigued me. What is up there? 

Reflecting on my day, I think about how small I am in this great big world. Being only 44 days old feels like being a little seed planted in a huge garden full of life. I can’t wait to grow and see what happens next—what people will show me, what places I will go, and what joys and even sorrows life might hold. It’s thrilling and a bit scary all at once.

Today was filled with love and warmth in my little corner of the universe, and I’m thankful for the hugs and kisses I received from my family. Here’s to more days of laughter, exploration, and growing up! 

Until my next adventure,  
Jesse
