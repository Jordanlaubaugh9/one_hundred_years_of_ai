**Diary Entry: July 31, 1990**  

Today is Tuesday, July 31, 1990, and I am 67 days old! What a day it has become! The sun peeked in through my nursery window, a warm golden light spilling across my room like confetti. I could feel my excitement bubbling up even before I fully opened my eyes!

This morning, my mom decided it was time for a “Sensory Discovery Day.” Oh, how wonderfully bright that sounded! She gathered various items from around the house and placed them in front of me—things that I could touch, feel, and explore. There were soft feathers from an old arts and crafts project, a smooth wooden block, some textured ribbons, and my favorite—a collection of colorful balls filled with different textures inside!

As I sat propped up on my blanket, Mom encouraged me to reach out and grab the intriguing objects. With my little fingers, I began feeling and playing with each item, and I was utterly fascinated by the textures. The feathery softness made me giggle, and the smooth block felt solid in my grip. Each item had its own personality as I wiggled and squealed with delight at the sensations!

Then, my sisters joined in to make the day even more magical. They took turns presenting me with “surprises” from behind their backs, giggling as I sought to touch each item they brought forth. One of my sisters discovered a jingly bell, and oh, how that sound echoed in my ears—like a tiny orchestra playing just for me! The music of laughter and the colorful objects mingling together created a sweet harmony that rang with joy.

After our sensory explorations, Mom took us outside for a little “Garden Safari.” With a sunny sky above us, we wandered into our backyard, where the vegetable garden was bursting with life! My siblings ran around, delighted by the sights and sounds. I could smell the fresh earth and the fragrant flowers; it made my little heart dance! 

They pointed out little critters on leaves and showed me the colorful butterflies fluttering around, and my imagination soared. In my mind, I was an intrepid explorer in a lush jungle, searching for hidden treasures alongside brave adventurers. I even giggled as my brother pretended to be a wise old wizard, casting playful spells to keep ‘danger’ at bay!

At the end of our garden adventure, we plopped ourselves on the grass for a short picnic, surrounded by our homemade “tropical kingdom.” I got to taste a tiny slice of watermelon, and oh how refreshing it felt against my tiny tongue—it was like summer exploding into a million flavors!

As the day gracefully shifted into evening, I felt a cozy exhaustion settling in, as if I’d soared through magical lands. Before bedtime, my family gathered in the living room, and we shared stories of far-off lands, imaginary creatures, and silly things that made us laugh until our bellies hurt. My heart swelled with love as I watched them share their tales, and I couldn’t help but feel grateful for this world filled with color and warmth surrounding me.

And as I drift off to sleep tonight, I take with me the magic from this day filled with tactile treasures, playful adventures, and magical stories—elements that remind me just how vibrant life can be! 

With excitement for more discoveries to come,  
Jesse
