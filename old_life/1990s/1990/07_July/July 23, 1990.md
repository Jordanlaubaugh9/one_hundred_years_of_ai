**Diary Entry: July 23, 1990**

Today is Monday, July 23, 1990, and I am 59 days old! It’s a bright, invigorating day filled with new experiences that have swept me off my tiny feet. I woke up to a soft melody humming through the air—it was as if the day was calling my name, urging me to discover what magic awaited.

The moment I opened my eyes, I noticed a curious little barbering ritual happening in our living room. My sisters had transformed a couple of stuffed animals into little clients for their modern-day salon! The gathering was full of giggles; they adorned the plush creatures with hair made from vibrant ribbons they snipped and tied together like fairy-tale hairstyles. I feel like I held a front-row seat to the craziest, most colorful fashion show just created in our home!

I, of course, wanted in on the action! As the chief audience member and stylist's assistant, my delighted squeals drew everyone’s attention. My sisters encouraged me to “participate” by creating a new character! They wrapped a shoelace around one of the stuffed animals and declared it a “rockstar bunny.” Oh, the hilarity that ensued! My siblings called out outrageous names like “Bun Jovi” and “Sir Hopsalot,” and I couldn’t contain my joyous laughter as they paraded around the living room with their newly styled friends.

Later in the day, Dad decided it was time to indulge in a family cook-off. I watched with rapt attention as he set things up in the kitchen. My siblings were all given little tasks—my brother worked on making “paw-tastic” cookies in the shape of their stuffed animals (he was convinced they were “deliciously adorable”). I sat with my little hands reaching for the colorful ingredients, eager to join the festivities even though I was still too wee for most tasks.

As each playful culinary masterpiece unfolded, it was like being in the middle of an art gallery! My heart swelled with excitement as I experienced the colors, smells, and delightful chaos that enveloped the kitchen. The laughter we shared made the flavors come alive, and I remembered that cooking is an art of its own kind. 

During this culinary adventure, curiosity struck me—the sounds of sizzling pans, the rhythm of laughter, and the delightful chaos reminded me of a carnival! It was an orchestra of fun—each note creating a memory that would stick with me forever. My tummy rumbled in anticipation for the tasty creations to come!

As evening rolled around, the warmth from our gathering turned to glowing stories by the kitchen table. My siblings recounted the silliest moments from our kitchen escapades, and my laughter echoed through our home as if music filled the air. I felt a wave of gratitude wash over me for these precious moments we shared together.

Tonight, as I drift off to sleep, I reflect on the warmth of my family and the laughter that creates our unique bond. Every day feels like a new adventure waiting for me—a blank canvas unfolding into a tapestry of colors and laughter. I can hardly wait to see what tomorrow brings!

With my heart aglow with joy,  
Jesse
