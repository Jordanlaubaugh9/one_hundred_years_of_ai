July 1, 1990

Dear Journal,

Today is Sunday, July 1, 1990! The sun was shining brightly, and I felt excited for all the new things this day would bring. I think it’s pretty cool to start a fresh month with a burst of energy, don't you? 

This morning, I woke up with a little giggle as I saw the rays of sunshine playing on my crib. I stretched my tiny arms, and I think I might have done a little happy dance! There’s something magical about waking up to the world each day—almost like it’s a gift wrapped in love and smiles waiting for me to unwrap it.

After breakfast, Mom and Dad decided to take the whole family to our local farmer's market. I didn’t know what to expect, but boy, was I in for a treat! When we arrived, I was greeted by a riot of colors and sounds. There were vibrant fruits and vegetables everywhere, and the air was filled with the sweet smell of flowers and baked goods. I felt like I was in a rainbow! 

Mom held me close, and we walked around. I reached out my pudgy little hands, trying to grab at everything, fascinated by all the beautiful sights. I think I spotted a stall selling homemade jams, and, oh, they looked amazing! I couldn’t understand what they were, but something excited bubbled inside me, like they were the treasures of the land. Maybe one day, I’ll get to taste them!

I will talk about a farm today! There was also a petting zoo with fluffy bunnies and fuzzy goats! Mom brought me close to the animals, and I squealed with delight, my little heart racing. The goats had such funny faces and made the silliest noises! I loved it when they'd nuzzle against my hands; it tickled! I could sense my siblings getting excited too, pointing and laughing at all the playful antics. They really make the world a happier place, don’t they? 

After spending the day at the market, we headed home, and it was time for my nap. As I drifted off, I couldn't help but dream of all the wonders I saw today—the bright colors, the giggling goats, and the happy faces. 

Something pivotal happened today too! Sitting in the back of the car, I overheard Mom and Dad chatting about how they want me to grow up to be kind and adventurous, to explore the world and seize opportunities. Wow, that sounds fantastic! I want to do so much! The thought tickled my little brain like a bubble escape; who knows what marvelous things lie ahead? 

As the evening came, we gathered for dinner, and Dad joked about today’s trip, making all of us laugh with his funny impressions of the goats. Laughter truly binds a family, and it made my tiny heart leap with joy! 

Before bed, Mom read me a story about faraway places filled with treasure hunts and pirates! Though I can’t understand every word yet, the sound of her voice was soothing—a melody that will always be a part of my dreams.

So here’s to the beginning of July and all the adventures I have ahead! 

Sweet dreams to all the livin’ little ones out there,  
Jesse
