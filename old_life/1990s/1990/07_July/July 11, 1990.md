**Diary Entry: July 11, 1990**  
Today is Wednesday, July 11, 1990. I am now 47 days old! What a wonderful day it has been in my little life! 

This morning started in much the same way as the others, with the sun shining brightly through the window and mom humming as she prepared breakfast for everyone. The smells of waffles and syrup wafted through the air, and my tummy rumbled in anticipation, even though I'm still just an observer of these delightful meals.

After breakfast, something new happened! My dad brought out a big fluffy teddy bear to play with me. It was soft and warm, and he placed it gently beside me in the crib. The bear was almost as big as I was! I popped up my little hand, and when I felt the teddy's fur, I could not help but giggle. There’s something so magical about the sensation! I can only imagine how many adventures this bear has seen, and what stories he could tell if only he could talk.

You know, I’ve started to notice more sounds around me. Later in the day, I heard my sisters arguing playfully over who got to hold me first. Their laughter echoed like sweet music in my ears, and even though I can’t quite say what it feels like to hug them, I can sense their love wrapping around me like a cozy blanket. I think being the youngest in the family means I’ll always be a little center of attention, and I do love it!

However, the day wasn’t without its challenges. I had this moment when my mom accidentally knocked over a glass while trying to grab my bottle, and it shattered loudly on the floor. The noise startled me, and I could feel a wave of unease wash over the room. My dad quickly swooped in, cleaning up the mess, while my mom wrapped her arms around me, whispering soothing words until I calmed down. It was a little reminder that even in a happy family, accidents happen.

As the evening rolled around, my brother came home from playing outside. He’s always had a way of bringing fun into the house. He scooped me up for a quick tickle. I couldn’t help but let out squeals that must have filled our entire home! It was in that moment I realized how much joy and laughter my family holds. 

Looking back on my day, I realize there’s much to cherish in even the simplest happenings. A big teddy bear, a playful argument, an accident that reminds us to be cautious, and the gentle embrace of love - it all wraps around me like a cherished story waiting to be told. 

I’m feeling grateful for my small but wonderful life. There’s so much beauty all around me, and I cannot wait for tomorrow to bring even more new experiences! 

With a heart full of joy,  
Jesse
