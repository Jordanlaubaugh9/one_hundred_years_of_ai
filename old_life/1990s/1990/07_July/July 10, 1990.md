**Diary Entry: July 10, 1990**  
Today is Tuesday, July 10, 1990. I am now a whole 46 days old! It feels like a tiny lifetime within these short weeks. I’ve been thinking a lot about how much of life there is to soak in, and today felt like a day full of new discoveries.

This morning, I woke up and the world outside my window was bright and cheerful. My dad came into my room, and while I can't quite remember everything, I could feel his energy. He picked me up and took me to the living room where everyone was gathered together. I felt special to be in the center of it all. It’s amazing how even though I’m so little, I can bring everyone together like this.

Later on, something magical happened. My mom decided to introduce me to music. She turned on the radio! There were all these different sounds - some were fast and happy, while others were slow and soothing. I could feel the rhythm in my very bones, and I started moving my little arms and legs as if trying to dance! It made my sisters giggle, and in that moment, I felt like I was part of something big, even if I didn’t understand it all yet. 

As I listened, I heard the news lady on the radio talking about something called the “Bain & Company” meeting with the “G7 leaders.” I don't quite get what that all means yet, but my parents seemed very interested. I could feel the seriousness in their voices. It feels strange to think that while I'm busy discovering the joy of music, there are things happening out in the world that I can't even fathom yet.

The day took a turn later when I noticed my brother looking sad, and it made me feel a little heavy in my heart. I caught snippets of whispers between my parents that day about something going on in the country. I may be just a baby, but I pick up on emotions, and I could tell that not everything was perfect. It made me aware that while I’m wrapped in love and warmth, the world outside can sometimes be uneasy.

Reflecting on my day, I’m reminded that life is a swirling mix of happiness and challenges. The music brought me joy and excitement, but understanding my family’s different feelings also taught me about care and empathy. 

There’s so much waiting to be discovered! I can't wait for tomorrow, another chance to learn and grow. Each day, in its own beautiful chaos, is a new chance to find a little more sunshine in my world.

Until my next new adventure,  
Jesse
