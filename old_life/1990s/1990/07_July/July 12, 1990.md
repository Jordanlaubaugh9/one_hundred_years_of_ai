**Diary Entry: July 12, 1990**  
Today is Thursday, July 12, 1990. I am now 48 days old! What a fascinating world I am beginning to explore! Somehow, today feels different, filled with sensations and experiences that make this little heart of mine flutter with excitement. 

This morning, my dad woke up extra early to get a start on his day. I think he had a pep in his step because the sun was shining bright and warm outside. It made everything feel like a beautiful canvas shimmering in a spectrum of colors. Mom was busy preparing breakfast again, but she took a moment to pick me up and show me the colorful mobiles hanging above my crib. The way they danced with little breezes was mesmerizing! She even sang a sweet little tune while turning them, and it felt like I was in a magical dream of colors and sound.

Later on, my sisters decided to have a little “fashion show.” They dressed up in their costumes and twirled around the living room, showing off sequined dresses and fairy wings.  I watched them with wide eyes, absorbing their happy energy as they squealed and laughed. When they saw me, they realized I could be a part of the show too, so they brought their sparkly hairbands and carefully adorned me with one—oh, how I wish I could remember how it felt to wear it on my head! 

During mid-afternoon, my family zoomed off for a short trip to a beautiful park nearby. It was my first outing! I was snuggled up in my car seat, and the ride was an adventure in itself. Looking through the window, I saw trees shooting up tall like towers and clouds drifting by like soft, fluffy sheep. The excitement made my little hands wiggle, not quite knowing how to process the vastness of all the nature surrounding me. 

Once we arrived, the air was filled with the scent of blooming flowers, and birds sang beautiful songs in the trees. Mom found a cozy spot on the grass, and while the rest of the family played frisbee, I lay there taking it all in. I could feel the soft blanket underneath me, the gentle breeze caressed my face, and the cheerful sounds wrapped around me like a warm hug. There was something grounding yet ethereal about being outdoors, a feeling that somehow pulled me closer to the heartbeat of the world. 

In the midst of that joyful commotion, I felt my tummy rumble—oh no! It seems like I had to let everyone know about my need for a snack, which turned their fun into a little side venture to keep me calm. My sisters rushed over, worried about their little brother, and Mom set things right with my bottle. Their compassion for me made me beam from within! 

As the day came to close and we returned home, I couldn’t help but reflect on the beauty of family moments. Their laughter, their playful antics, and the kindness they keep showing me reminds me that every day is an opportunity for love and joy.

With the stillness of night settling around me, I smiled in my crib, dreaming of all the fun to come. At just 48 days old, I feel like I’m only beginning to scratch the surface of this wondrous existence. Life is indeed a fascinating journey filled with cherished experiences that will shape who I am—one day at a time!

With excitement for tomorrow,  
Jesse
