July 5, 1990

Dear Journal,

Today is Wednesday, July 5, 1990, and you won’t believe the fun I had! I woke up to the most wondrous surprise—today was not just any ordinary day but a day full of new sights and sounds! It felt like the world had come alive just for me.

This morning, after I gobbled up breakfast with my family, an unexpected visitor arrived. Mom opened the door, and there stood a friendly delivery man holding a big, colorful package! I could hardly believe my eyes! Inside, it felt like magic still tingling in the air. It turned out to be a music box, beautifully crafted with shimmering designs all over. I can hardly contain my excitement! 

Mom wound it up, and to my amazement, it began to play the loveliest tune! The music danced all around the room, filling every corner with joy. The soft notes seemed to wrap around me like a comforting hug. Oh, how I wanted to sway and wiggle my little toes to the rhythm! I felt like a tiny leaf floating down a stream, carried away by the gentle current.

Next, we had an impromptu dance party in our living room! As the music flowed, everyone got up to join in. Mom twirled me in her arms, spinning around like we were flying! My siblings hopped around like little rabbits, giggling and clapping their hands. It felt like we were all part of a remarkable celebration, where every swirl and giggle blended into an unforgettable symphony of love!

After our dance extravaganza, I laid on the soft carpet, listening to the last lingering notes of the music. I could feel the happiness swirling around me like magic dust, and thoughts raced through my little mind. I imagined being in a grand concert hall one day, somewhere far away, surrounded by musical wonders! I dreamed of singing along to the powerful melodies that could float me up into the sky, where the clouds would dance freely.

The rest of the day unfolded like a movie. Mom took us to the library, where I stared wide-eyed at rows and rows of books. To most people, they might just be pages and words, but to me, they felt like gateways into worlds I’ve yet to discover! I kept begging Mom to pick out a book filled with dragons and wizards—just like in the stories my siblings tell me—but we settled on a cozy tale about a brave little kitten exploring its new home. I can’t wait for bedtime! The thought of snuggling in my crib and drifting off to new adventures in my dreams makes me giggle with joy!

As the sun began to set, I felt gratitude swell within me. Today was painted with happiness, discovery, and love. I closed my eyes, imagining the music still dancing through the air, the sweet stories waiting for me at bedtime, and all the wonderful new days that lie ahead. Life is a beautiful melody, and I want to soak up every note!

Signing off with lovely thoughts and sweet dreams,  
Jesse
