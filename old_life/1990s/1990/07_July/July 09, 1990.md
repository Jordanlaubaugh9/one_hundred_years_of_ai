**Diary Entry: July 09, 1990**  
Today is Monday, July 09, 1990. I’m now a whole 45 days old, and it’s exciting to think about all the new things I’m beginning to experience! The world feels like a treasure box just waiting for me to discover its wonders.

This morning, my mom introduced me to something wonderful. As she gently rocked me in her arms, she placed a soft, colorful book in front of me. It has bright pictures of animals and flowers, and she read the words aloud with enthusiasm. I can’t quite understand everything yet, but seeing the colors and hearing her voice made me feel warm and safe. When she pointed to a big fluffy dog, I let out a happy coo. I think I might love books already!

Later, my dad pulled out an old, soft blanket, and we all gathered in the living room just to relax together. My older brother had the bright idea to play a little game. They all took turns making funny sounds and faces to make me laugh. I giggled so much that it made my sides feel tickly! I think my family really loves to entertain me, and it feels amazing to be the center of their joy. I don’t know what I did to deserve all this happiness, but I’m thankful!

Today also reminded me that not every day is all sunshine and laughter. I heard my parents talking in hushed voices later on. They seemed a little worried about something, but they didn’t tell me what it was. I guess they want to protect me from grown-up problems for now. I could feel a little tension in the air, and it reminded me that life has both happy moments and challenges. When I watched my mom give my dad a reassuring smile, I was comforted that even during tough times, love is what keeps us strong.

Looking back on today, I am filled with a sense of wonder and love. The world continues to unfold like a blooming flower around me, revealing little bits of beauty, joy, and even some shadows. I think I'm learning that every day can be an adventure, whether I’m laughing, playing, learning from books, or even feeling a bit of concern. Each experience adds color to my life’s canvas. 

Here’s to the beauty of today and all the days yet to come!

With love,  
Jesse
