July 6, 1990

Dear Journal,

Today is Saturday, July 6, 1990, and it feels like the world is full of surprises! When I opened my eyes, the sunlight peeked into my little room like a friend ready to play. It was a lovely morning, and I could hear birds cheerfully chirping outside as if they were announcing a new adventure just for me!

This morning, Mom decided we could have an arts and crafts day! Oh, the thrill of it all! She set up a small table in the living room and laid out colorful sheets of paper, a box of crayons, and shiny stickers that sparkled like little stars. The mere sight set my heart racing with joy! I couldn't contain my excitement, so I wriggled around in my chair, eagerly wondering what we would create together!

Mom encouraged me to express my imagination, so I started scribbling on a piece of paper—up and down, round and round, whatever came to my little mind! Although my pictures looked a little bit like wiggly monsters, Mom assured me that they were beautiful. She kept smiling, and her laughter wrapped around me like a warm hug. The thought that my little scribbles could bring her joy was oh-so-delightful!

As the hours passed, I watched Mom craft her masterpieces with grace. She created vibrant paper flowers and butterflies, and I marveled at how the colors seemed to dance in her hands. I tried mimicking her movements, and somehow, I ended up with a handful of crumpled paper that looked like it had been through quite an adventure! Mom turned it into a magical creation, and we both laughed at how it transformed into a silly hat that I immediately wore on my little head. It's like I was crowned the king of creativity!

Just as we finished our art session, a sudden rain shower tapped gently on the window pane. The sound was soothing—like nature's own melody. We gazed outside, watching raindrops race down the glass like tiny little racers. Mom told me that the rain helps flowers bloom and keeps the world green and healthy. Such magical rain! Maybe one day I'll discover how to dance with the raindrops too!

That afternoon, once the rain subsided, something amazing happened! Mom decided to give me a little bubble bath! As we moved to the bathroom, I could sense the excitement building up. The water filled the tub, and mom poured in bubble soap that turned everything into a fluffy, fizzy foam party! I giggled as I splashed around, watching the bubbles float away like dreams escaping into the sky. Each bubble felt like a secret whisper, sharing tales from the world beyond.

After my bubbly adventure, Dad came home, and I could tell he had news full of excitement! "Guess what, kiddo?" he said, with a twinkle in his eye. He had just seen that a famous traveling circus was coming to town! My heart raced as I envisioned a magical world of acrobats soaring through the air, clowns juggling with bright colors, and even dazzling lions performing tricks! Oh, how I longed to witness such wonders!

We spent the evening in deeper discussions, planning our trip to the circus, which made me beam with glee. The anticipation bubbled within me like fireworks just waiting to burst into the night sky! The prospect of seeing tightrope walkers and balancing acts sent shivers of delight down my spine. 

As I snuggled into my cozy crib, I couldn’t help but smile at the thought of today—the laughter, the artistry, and the promise of adventures waiting right around the corner. I drifted off to sleep, dreaming of colorful bubbles, oversized hats, and a circus that would bring magic to my little world.

To more adventures tomorrow!
