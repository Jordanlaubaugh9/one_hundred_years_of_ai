**Diary Entry: July 13, 1990**  
Today is Friday, July 13, 1990. I am now 49 days old, and I can feel the world swelling with all sorts of wonders around me! Today has been different from any other day so far, filled with thrilling new experiences that made my tiny heart race with joy.

This morning, something utterly unexpected happened. My family gathered around me as Mom announced it was time for a “Baby Science Day.” I think they wanted to introduce me to the world of colors and textures! I couldn’t contain my curiosity as they brought out soft fabrics, shiny paper, and even fruits that smelled sweet. They laid out a bright blanket in the living room and surrounded me with all kinds of intriguing objects.

First up was a bunch of colorful scarves. My sisters expertly waved them like colorful flags, and it was as if they were summoning the rainbow itself! They twirled them high above my head, and I giggled as the brilliant colors danced in the sunlight streaming through the window. It reminded me of how colorful stories must be in books, full of life and adventure.

Then, Mom introduced me to the sensations of touch with different textures. She gently placed a soft, fuzzy teddy bear next to me, which I loved, but then she followed it by bringing out a bumpy rubber ball. When my little fingers felt the ball’s surface, it was so different from the soft bear! I played with them together, and it felt like I was discovering a new universe of senses.

Next came a surprise: a small bowl of strawberries! My family giggled as they took turns gently passing the strawberries over to me. The exciting promise of sweetness was there, even if I couldn’t quite taste them just yet. Watching them enjoy the fruit made me wish I could join in. Their laughter filled the room and lifted my spirit; it was contagious! I felt like I was part of their little celebration, even from my cozy blanket.

Amid all this playful chaos, however, I felt a moment of uncertainty too. At one point, my little hand accidentally knocked over the bowl, sending the strawberries rolling across the floor. For a tiny moment, I saw my sisters gasp, and I felt a wave of worry wash over me as they scrambled to pick up the mess. But then Mom chuckled and said, “It’s part of the fun, Jesse!” Their laughter broke the tension, and I learned that it’s perfectly okay to make mistakes sometimes, especially when new experiences are so exciting.

As the day wrapped up, I settled down in my crib, feeling both exhausted and ecstatic. Reflecting on my day, I realized how important it is to explore the world around me. Each new texture, color, and sound adds a layer to the vast tapestry of life that I’m still just starting to grasp. 

Today reminded me that living is about playfulness and curiosity, and it’s wonderful how my family continues to invite me into their world filled with laughter and love. I’m grateful for these sweet moments that fill my young heart, and I am eager to see what other surprises the coming days will bring!

With wonder and anticipation,  
Jesse
