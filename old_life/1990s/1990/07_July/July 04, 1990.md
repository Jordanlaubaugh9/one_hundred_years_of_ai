July 4, 1990

Dear Journal,

Today is a day buzzing with excitement! It's July 4th, 1990, and I can feel the buzz in the air like a gentle hum. The sun is shining bright, and today is the celebration of Independence Day! This morning, I woke up with the anticipation of all the fun and festivities that are in store. It's like everyone in the whole world is waiting for the big fireworks show to light up the night sky!

Mom and Dad have been planning a special family gathering for today. Siblings were buzzing about all the exciting things we would do later. I can't wait to see what goodies they’ve prepared! The thought of delicious food makes my little tummy rumble. I heard whispers about barbecue—whatever that is, it sounds like something I would enjoy! Also, the mention of fruity drinks made my eyes widen. I've seen adults sip colored liquids and make happy faces, so I’m eager to sample something delightful!

The house is filled with laughter and music. Dad cranked up the radio, and I heard the upbeat sound of patriotic songs playing. Even though I may not truly understand the meaning behind them yet, I'm pretty sure they must capture the spirit of the day! Everyone's energy is alive and bright like the sun itself. It’s like the radio is throwing a party right in our living room!

In the afternoon, Mom decided to gather us all outside for some fun in the sun. She set up a big blanket and brought out sparkling lemonade, an elixir of summer that glistens like treasure in a pirate's chest! My siblings spread out their special treats, and somehow I ended with some sweet fruit on my little plate. Yum! I can feel a smile stretch across my face when someone offers me a piece!

After our festive picnic, we played games with baby rockets made from colorful paper and candy! Watching them zoom up into the sky felt like magic—it seemed like my little wishes were being sent off with every launch! I jumped in excitement, seeing the world around me dance with joy. 

As the sun dipped low, the sky transitioned into a beautiful painting of pinks and oranges. The time for fireworks was approaching! I could feel my heart flutter as anticipation grew. And at last, as evening fell, the spectacular show began! Bright lights filled the sky, colors exploding in patterns that made my little jaw drop. I think I may have squealed in delight—I couldn’t help it! Each crackle and pop made the world sparkle and shimmer like the most thrilling dream!

While everyone oohed and aahed, I couldn’t get enough! It felt like the sky was spinning tales of wonder that only I could hear. More than the colors, it was the warmth of being surrounded by my family that made it all feel so special. Their laughter washed over me like waves of joy, wrapping me in love from every direction. 

As the last firework faded and the stars emerged, I knew tonight would be etched in my memory for years to come. What a perfect day it has been! I fell asleep imagining being a part of the sky—the twinkling stars and the dazzling flowers of fireworks decorating this world. I can’t wait to see what the next adventure will bring, for even the skies are calling me to dream!

Dreamy and delighted,  
Jesse
