July 3, 1990

Dear Journal,

Today is Tuesday, July 3, 1990. I can hardly believe how fast the days are passing! This morning was bright and cloudy, a gentle reminder that the world is an interesting mix of colors and feelings. I started my day with curious coos as Mom walked in. She sang a little song, and it made my heart dance! It's moments like these when I feel so loved—like I’m wrapped in a warm hug. 

In the afternoon, something extraordinary happened! Mom decided to bathe me in the big tub. At first, I was surprised! The water felt like a cool breeze all over my skin, and I couldn't help but splash my little feet around. I giggled so much, I think I could have filled the whole tub with my joy! Sometimes, when I kick my legs, it feels like I'm dancing in rivers of rainbows! 

After my bath, once I was all snuggled in a cozy towel, Mom set up a little playtime. She pulled out these colorful blocks—oh, they are so bright! She showed me how to stack them up, and even though I couldn’t quite do it yet, I loved watching them tumble down with little thuds! I clapped my hands in glee when some bottles knocked over. It felt like a little celebration of colors! Mom told me one day, I'll build towers that touch the sky! 

Later on, my siblings gathered around me. They were drawing with crayons on big sheets of paper. I watched in awe as they created their masterpieces! I could see happy suns, swirling rainbows, and magical creatures filled with life and imagination. They told me stories about the pictures they were drawing, and even though I can’t quite understand it all yet, their words flowed like music in the air. I felt our family bond stretching and growing, like reaching out to the stars!

As the sun began to set, casting a warm glow in the room, I felt a peaceful laughter bubble within me. I heard faint fireworks in the distance, and oh! The thought of sparklers lit my imagination. My family talked about how tomorrow would be the Fourth of July, a day filled with fireworks and celebrations! I could picture lights bursting like colorful flowers blooming in the night sky. If only I could catch them and store them in a jar—what a treasure that would be! 

Tonight, as we gathered for dinner, I noticed the delightful smell of grilled hot dogs wafting through the kitchen. I heard my siblings squawking about how they can wait for grilled treats during the festivities tomorrow. Their laughter echoed like little treasures, and I looked around, my heart swelling with warmth. 

As I settled into bed, I felt grateful for today—the joy, laughter, and dreams that filled every moment. I can’t wait to see what magical adventures await me on this journey of life. 

Sleep tight, little one! The world is calling out your name! 

Goodnight,  
Jesse
