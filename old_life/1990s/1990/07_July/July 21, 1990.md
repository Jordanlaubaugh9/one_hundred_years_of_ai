**Diary Entry: July 21, 1990**  

Today is Saturday, July 21, 1990, and I am 57 days old! What a day filled with vibrant colors and new sounds! As I sit in my cozy corner, I feel so lucky to have the world around me bursting with magic, and today was no exception.

The sun peeked through the window early this morning, illuminating the room in a bright glow. Mom had this enchanting idea—it was “Fairy Tale Day”! She pulled out a collection of storybooks, and my siblings gathered excitedly to listen. They made a chorus of joyous sounds, and I squirmed with delight, unable to contain my curiosity. Each page, with its vivid illustrations, felt like a secret world waiting to be discovered.

As my siblings narrated the tales, they transformed into the characters themselves! My sisters twirled like princesses in dreamy ball gowns, while my brother took on the role of a mighty dragon, roaring and pretending to guard us. I couldn’t stop giggling at how serious they seemed, completely immersed in their imaginary play. It made my little heart race with wonder! I may not have been able to join in the wild adventures yet, but I could feel the magic of their stories wrap around me like a soft blanket.

During our fairy tale exploration, Mom brought out some finger puppets, and while the stories took new shapes, I caught sight of a mischievous little mouse puppet. It wiggled and danced around, bringing giggles and squeals echoing through the room. I watched fondly while my siblings created their own stories, where they, too, became part of the characters, their imaginations taking flight like butterflies.

As afternoon rolled in, I found myself lying on a colorful play mat filled with different textures and images from the stories. It felt like my own little world of dreams under the gaze of stars painted onto the fabric. My mom noticed my fascination and plopped down beside me. She began to tell one of my favorite fairy tales—the story of Jack and the Beanstalk. I was spellbound! The way her voice danced through the air cast a spell over me. The beanstalk reaching high into the sky felt like a bridge to endless adventures, and my mind couldn’t help but wander off into fantastic realms, where I could picture sparkling giants and enchanted lands.

As the sun started to set, casting a warm glow over everything, we gathered around a big blanket on the living room floor. It felt like we were camping under the stars. Mom shared stories about her childhood adventures and the wonders she encountered while growing up. She shared tales of friendship, courage, and the importance of imagination. It filled me with an indescribable warmth in my tiny heart—a sense of unity and love that can only be found while nestled among family.

Today showed me that life is brimming with magic if we open our hearts and share our stories. Each chapter we discover extends our understanding of the world and inspires us to dream even bigger. Even at 57 days old, I feel an exciting adventure stirring within me, like the birth of a new fairy tale waiting to be written.

With dreams dancing in my heart,  
Jesse
