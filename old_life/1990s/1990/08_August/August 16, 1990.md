Dear Diary,

Today was special because we went on an adventure that I’ve been looking forward to for a long time! Mom planned a trip to the local petting zoo, and I could hardly contain my excitement! I could barely sleep last night just thinking about all the cute animals I’d get to see and maybe even touch.

When we arrived at the zoo, the first thing I noticed was the smell—kind of a mix of hay and, well, animal—just like I imagined. The sun was blazing, and I could hear all the kids around me squealing with joy; it felt like the happiest place in the world. 

Right as we entered, we saw a fluffy goat. Oh, he was adorable! I couldn’t help but laugh as he kept butting his little head against my leg like he was playing tag. I didn’t know goats were so silly! Mom took a picture of me giggling, and I know I'll treasure that memory forever. I even named him Sir Baa-a-lot in my mind. 

After that, we ventured over to see the bunnies. They were so soft and quick! There were all sorts of them hopping around. I gently held one in my hands, and it wiggled a little bit, but I felt like a real animal whisperer! I imagined that somehow I could understand what he was thinking; maybe he wanted to hop into a world of endless carrots! 

Then, we went to the barn area to see some piglets. Oh wow! They were so small and funny-looking! One little guy started rolling around in the mud, and I couldn’t stop laughing at how messy he looked. Mom said he was definitely going to need a bath after that. It was sweet seeing so many kids run about squealing, their faces all lit up with pure happiness. 

But the day took a surprising turn when we headed toward the end of our trip. I overheard some older kids talking nearby, and they were saying mean things about my sister Sarah, who was trying to pet a sheep. That made me feel sad. She hadn’t done anything wrong, and I wanted to defend her—but I was a little scared. 

I took a deep breath and approached the kids and stood up tall. I reminded them that everyone should just have fun and enjoy the animals. They didn’t say much to me, and then they wandered off, but I felt proud of myself for speaking up. 

At the end of the day, once we returned home, something magical happened. Mom surprised me with cookies right from the oven, warm and gooey. We sat at the kitchen table, sharing stories from our day, laughing about Sir Baa-a-lot and the silly pigs. It’s moments like this that remind me how much I treasure my family—no matter what else happens, we always have each other to rely on.

As I crawl into bed tonight, I can’t help but smile, thinking of all the wonderful animals I saw and the adventure we had. Life feels pretty amazing when you get to be a kid and explore the world!

Goodnight,  
Jesse
