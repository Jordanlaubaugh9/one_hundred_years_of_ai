Dear Diary,

Today was a whirlwind of adventure! It’s a hot summer day here in Michigan, and the sun shines brightly over everything. I woke up to the smell of pancakes—my favorite! Mom makes the fluffiest ones, and I can’t resist pouring maple syrup all over them. She's the best at making breakfast; Carl, my older brother, claims he makes the best pancakes, but I don’t think they compare! 

After breakfast, I played outside with my sisters. Sarah was pretending to be a queen while Ellie played the valiant knight defending her. I giggled a lot as they bantered back and forth with royal decree and valiant rescue plans. I couldn't help but jump into the fun and declared myself the wizard who bestows magical powers! We created a whole story about the brave knight rescuing the queen from an evil dragon that lived in the bushes. We played until the sun was high in the sky, and the heat made us really thirsty.

Later in the day, we went to the library. I love books! I picked out a new adventure story about pirates. I dream of sailing the seven seas one day. I can just imagine battling storms and finding hidden treasures—what fun! I accidentally knocked over a stack of books when I turned too quickly and felt embarrassed, but the librarian was nice and helped me pick them up.

In Canada, they just had a historic vote where the House of Commons passed a motion to allow same-sex marriage. It feels kinda cool to think about how things are changing in the world around me even if I’m still just a kid. I hope it means that everyone can love who they want. 

As the day wound down, I climbed into bed feeling grateful for my family, my friends, and the silly, magical day we had. I can’t wait to see what adventures tomorrow will bring!

Goodnight,  
Jesse
