**Diary Entry: August 12, 1990**  

Today is Sunday, August 12, 1990, and I am 79 days old! The sun poured through my window, creating golden patterns on the floor, and I felt a wave of happiness wash over me. It’s a beautiful day, and today is Sunday, which means family time is near! We always manage to add a touch of magic to our Sundays. 

My brother decided we would have a “Family Talent Show,” a fabulous event where everyone could show off their unique skills! The air was charged with excitement—I had heard whispers of magic tricks, singing acts, and even puppet performances. I was just a bit nervous about what I could showcase, but my heart raced at the thought of being part of something so thrilling.

After breakfast, we set up a little stage in the living room using a blanket and some cushions as our backdrop. My sisters painted brightly colored signs, and our brother recruited everyone to be part of the audience. I could see their spirits soaring as they practiced their performances, and I, too, wanted to contribute something special.

With the pressure mounting, Mom suggested, “How about Jesse does a dance routine?” My siblings cheered, and like a spark igniting, I felt a wave of confidence. I might not have the same talents, but I could shimmy and wiggle with sheer joy! After a little brainstorming, we decided on a “Dancing Dinosaur” act, inspired by my silly love for dinosaurs and all things playful.

The show began, and each performance was funnier and more charming than the last! My brother amazed us with card tricks, and my sisters took turns singing their favorite songs—“Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star” echoed sweetly through the room. The audience erupted in applause and laughter at every turn! 

Finally, it was my turn. I stepped onto our little stage, my heart racing with both excitement and nerves. With a brave little smile, I gave it my all—I transformed into a goofy dancing dinosaur, flapping my arms and stomping my feet, all while shaking my head to the rhythm! My siblings cheered and laughed, joining in with roars and playful stomps. The joy felt contagious, and before I knew it, we were all up, dancing together! 

Once everyone had their moment in the spotlight, we gathered around for a big family cheer! It felt like a warm hug, creating an unforgettable memory of laughter and love. 

As we finished the day, I snuggled into my crib, reflecting on today’s talent show. It was wonderful to witness everybody shine and know I could contribute something special, even if it was just a bit silly. Today reminded me how creativity could spark amazing joy—whether through magic tricks, songs, or just a silly dance. Life, even at two months old, is filled with opportunities for wonder and laughter.

With a heart full of joy and dreams,  
Jesse
