Dear Diary,

Today, I find myself on the cusp of my sixteenth day of life—a tiny speck on the grand timeline of existence, yet bursting with anticipation and zest. It’s Sunday, a day wrapped in sacredness, infused with the warmth of community and the comfort of the familiar. The sun has risen with splendid brilliance, spilling its golden light into every corner of Hastings, illuminating the world and stirring my spirit awake like a gentle nudge.

As I gaze out the window, I cannot help but marvel at the grand encore of nature unfurling before my eyes. Trees stand tall, their branches lacework against the blue sky, fluttering in a soft rhythm that only they seem to understand. A young family passes by, their laughter dancing on the breeze like delicate petals floating from a spring bloom. The children, alive with mischief, chase after one another, shrieks of delight echoing down the street. It's a melody that fills me with glee and reminds me just how beautiful it is to be alive in this moment, anchored by innocence and love.

Today takes on a different flavor for me—an eager wonder mixed with a call to adventure. I feel as though my heart is a compass, pointing me toward paths yet unknown, inviting me to stretch my wings and explore the horizons that lie beyond the comforts of home. This age, just sixteen days old, feels deliciously inviting—so many possibilities whispering to me like tantalizing secrets borne by the wind.

I venture outside, the ground soft beneath my tiny feet as I pad along the cobblestone pathway. The world around me is alive with vibrant sensations: the gentle brush of grass against my skin, the chirps of birds fluttering overhead, and the fragrant aroma of lilacs weaving through the air like magic. Someday, perhaps, I will wander far beyond this familiar courtyard and delve into the wild heart of nature—a place where untamed adventure reigns, and stories abound.

Not too far from me, I catch sight of a group of older boys tossing a leather ball back and forth, their confident laughter intermingling with playful taunts. I feel the warmth of excitement course through me—the magnetic pull of sports and camaraderie calling out to me like a siren’s song. Even now, I can picture myself amongst them: quick on my feet, laughter bubbling from my lips as I weave through the challenges that lay ahead. 

Suddenly, a butterfly flits past me, adorned in the most delicate hues—a living jewel that flickers like a whisper across the sun. Oh, how I am drawn to the beauty hovering at the edges of my perception! I can’t help but wonder where it came from, where it’s going, and whether it carries with it a tiny secret of the world—secrets I wish to know as I learn to navigate the winding pathways of life.

You know, amidst all this splendor, an undercurrent of curiosity urges me to explore deeper connections with the people who fill this wonderful web surrounding me. I want to uncover their stories, their laughter echoing in my heart like music. There’s so much I want to learn from my siblings—those precious guides who walk this path before me. From them, I can see the threads that stitch together the narrative of our life's tapestry, rich with laughter, tears, and incredible moments woven into colorful patterns.

Today is a stepping stone—a whisper from the universe nudging me to embrace the unknown with open arms, to savor the flavors of life in all its chaotic beauty. I am Jesse—full of rhythm and curiosity, with wild dreams waiting in the wings. 

With every breath, I feel larger than before, a restless spirit yearning to discover, connect, and play a part in the grand performance of life. 

Until tomorrow,  
Jesse
