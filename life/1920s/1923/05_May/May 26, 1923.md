Dear Diary,

Today marks my very first day in this vast world! I feel like a tiny speck in the grand tapestry of life, yet here I am, breathing and existing. The air is crisp and sweet, full of the scents of springtime in Hastings. The birds are singing, and I can hear the distant laughter of my family as they celebrate me—the newest addition to our clan. 

It’s rather remarkable how much joy can fill a house just because of a little one like me! My siblings are overflowing with excitement. I can feel their energy buzzing all around, their warmth wrapping around me like a cozy blanket. It makes me wonder what adventures lie ahead for me. I don't yet know how to crawl, or walk, or even speak, but I feel it in my tiny body that there’s so much to explore and so much to learn. 

It seems like every day, the world is filled with stories, and as of late, people have been talking a lot about the rise in worker strikes. There’s a lot of unrest among laborers across the country, and even across the ocean in Europe. It's about the rights and wages of those who work so hard and deserve to be recognized. I hear whispers of debates at the dinner table about families struggling to make ends meet in these changing times. It's a big issue, and I sense it weighs heavy on the minds of those around me.

In much lighter news—my old sister, Anna, has painted the nursery with the brightest yellows and softest blues. I find myself captivated by the colors, even if I can’t quite comprehend them yet. I wonder, will they inspire me as I grow? I hope to fill my days with tones like that, imaginative and vibrant. I wish to be like the sunflowers that she painted—cheerful and bold, always facing the light.

For now, though, as I lie here in my little crib, I feel safe and loved. The world seems both big and quiet at this moment, a sense of wonder weaving through my tiny heart. It’s a beautiful mix, that of serenity and excitement, the anticipation for all that awaits me.

Until tomorrow,  
Jesse
